## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

* Implementing the search bar required ensuring that the game cards updated dynamically as the user typed, which took some debugging.
* Ensuring the visual changes like the glowing line and updated stats cards matched the overall design without breaking existing styles. 
* Overall, the instructions were really clear which made this a fun project to work on.
